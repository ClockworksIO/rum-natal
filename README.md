# Rum-Natal

[Rum-Natal](https://github.com/ClockworksIO/rum-natal) is a simple figwheel boilerplate to help developing [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) apps with [Clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org/). It uses [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum) as a react wrapper. It should be straight forward to adapt rum-natal to be able to use other react wrappers.

Rum-Natal is based on project [re-natal](https://github.com/drapanjanas/re-natal).

A main difference to re-natal in terms of additional features is the support for the currently newest react-native version _0.68.2_ that includes AndroidX support.

## Usage

Please refer to [the docs](resources/leiningen/new/rum_natal/rum-natal-usage.md) for further information on how to use rum-natal and its latest features and limitations.
